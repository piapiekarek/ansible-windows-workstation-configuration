# Ansible Windows workstation configuration

This Ansible playbook is an example for automated software installation. It is used to configure my Workstation.

## Requirements for Ansible host
The ansible host has to be a Linux machine. For the case that only a Windows (10!!!) Machine is availible, [install the Linux Subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) on the device.

Afterwards install pywinrm:

``` bash
## for debian and ubuntu
sudo apt-get install python3-winrm
## for fedora
sudo dnf install python3-winrm
```

## WinRM Setup
> on windows host

To access the client machines from remote winrm is used.

[Windows setup guide, see Chapter Setup WinRM](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_setup.html)

Run as administrator in powershell!

``` powershell
$url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"
$file = "$env:temp\ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"

(New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)

powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File $file
```
## Requirements for yml file
Change ansible_user and ansible_password in the vars section before running the script!

### Run on Ansible host

``` bash
ansible-playbook \
  windows-rtlab-test.yml \
  -i "<ip-address>," --user "<user_name>" --ask-pass

  #ansible-playbook windows-rtlab-test.yml -i "192.168.120.235," --user "John Doe" --ask-pass
```


Warning: The command above needs a comma separated list of arguments, thus the comma at the end of the IP Address.

### Set password and username in yml file instead of command line

Instead of passing the username and password arguments in the command line, you can set them inside the yml file (uncomment the lines ansible_user and ansible_password, and set both)

Afterwards run the following command:

``` bash
ansible-playbook \
  windows-rtlab-test.yml \
  -i "192.168.120.235,"

  #ansible-playbook windows-rtlab-test.yml -i "192.168.120.235,"
```

### Using inventory

Instead of passing the ip-addresses as arguments, they can be written into the inventoryfile (default: `/etc/ansible/hosts`)
```bash
# IP without any group
192.168.120.144

[group_name_1]
192.168.120.48
192.168.120.77

[group_name_2]
192.168.120.77 #same IP linke in Group group_name_1
192.168.120.79
192.168.120.119
```
Afterwards, the following shell commands can be used:
```bash
$ ansible-playbook <File_Name>
# or with a group
$ ansible-playbook <File_Name> -l group_name_1
```
## Git for Windows
> on ansible host

In order to do the cloning of git repositories on the windows machine, clone this repository to any location.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tivrobo/ansible-win_git.git
``` 
Change into the new folder and copy the two files **win_git.ps1** and **win_git.py** into *DEFAULT_MODULE_UTILS_PATH*: 
```bash
sudo cp ./win_git.ps1 /usr/share/ansible/plugins/module_utils
sudo cp ./win_git.py /usr/share/ansible/plugins/module_utils
```

> on windows host

The git clone only works if the ssh key of the device is given to Git in advance and the git clone command was used once.
